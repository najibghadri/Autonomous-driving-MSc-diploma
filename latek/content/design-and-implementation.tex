Let's recap the task flow of the task I described in the Introduction: After
configuring the simulator with the designed camera setting I render multiple
traffic scenarios in different maps provided by CARLA while extracting all
necessary information into a log file to later compare the detection log with

\section{Tools used}

Very soon it became obvious that a Linux operating system is the right way to
develop everything. I have been using Ubuntu before this project as well so I
was already familiar with everything. The main IDE I used throughout the project
is Visual Studio Code, which thanks to it's openness and community has a lot of
extensions that helped me develop in fact every part of the thesis: Python,
Nodejs and Javascript for the webvisualizer and finally LaTeX and ofcourse git
support.

- VS Code
- Python, Scripts, Conda, Jupyter

\section{Choosing the sensor suite}

Mounting cameras around the vehicle to have an all around vision is an essential
design strategy, as we have seen in the work of other companies in
\autoref{chap:relatedwork}. However we will need to determine depth as well. I
decided to use only cameras in a stereoscopic structure to create 4 stereo sides
around the vehicle. The following model shows the design setting \refstruc{fig:3dmodel3}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=150mm, keepaspectratio]{figures/3dmodel3.png}
    \caption{The stereo camera setting I used on top of the virtual Tesla Model 3}
    \label{fig:3dmodel3}
\end{figure}

The setting is the following in details: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Front stereo: two cameras looking straight to the front 0.8 meters
    apart
    \item Right corner and left corner stereo cameras: the cameras are on the
    diagonal corners of a 20 cm wide 20cm tall triangle creating two 45\degree
    angled stero vision.
    \item Right and left side stereos are turned 90\degree to the sides and they are apart 0.5 meter.
\end{itemize}

The advantage of puting cameras apart to a relatively large distance is it
increases the accuracy of the stereo algorithm to a further distance. However
the drawback is that a smaller portion of the right and left side image is going
to intersect hence creating a smaller field of view. However due to to corner
stereo cameras this is not a problem.
