Working on this thesis has been a very unique experience because the whole filed
was new to me before getting into it. I had to learn about basic computer vision
processing methods, algorithms, 3D vision, the camera model, convolutional
neural networks and deep learning and even a little bit of game engines because
of the simulator. But in the end I learned a lot of things that I hope I can use
soon in a nice AI company perhaps one that works on autopilots.
