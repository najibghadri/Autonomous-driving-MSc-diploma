It is important for a self-driving company to openly detail their technical
solution because it let's people trust their autopilot solution. However it
wasn't easy to find open information about the details of different companies,
because technology itself is in early stages. From the solutions of the
companies I analyized I got inspired on how a self-driving system must be built.
