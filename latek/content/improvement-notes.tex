In \autoref{chap:assumptions} I established some simplifications to the system.
In order to create a fully capable scene understanding algorithm the following
improvements are needed.

\section{Tracking and correlation}
In order to measure the accuracy of detections (false positives, false
negatives), it is important to correlate the positive detections with the most
likely ground truth actor. This could be done by finding the closest truth actor
to each detection. This should suffice, because in case there are huge errors,
intead the algorithm should be redesigned fundamentally!

\section{Faster instance segmentation with Yolact++}
A new research has emerged relating instance segmentation,
YOLACT~\cite{yolact-iccv2019} and YOLACT++~\cite{yolact-plus-arxiv2019}\footnote{
Yolact++ repository \url{https://github.com/dbolya/yolact}}, that achieves
30+fps on Titan X for instance segmentation and detection. It is based on YOLO
and uses the same resnet50 model that Detectron2 uses. If this convnet achieves
the same accuracy with a higher fps than it is replaceable with Detectron2.

\section{Optimal sensor suite}
We have seen that companies use many sensors combined not only rgb cameras. In
an optimal setting I would use only one stereo camera setting to the front and
rely on radar and ultrasonic sensors for depth data. Monodepth is also an option
to estimate or correct depth however research is still ongoing and it might not
be a stable method.

\section{Keypoint based detection and orientation}
Orientation, keypoint detection, wheel, etc detection
Depth not based on center point

\section{Data correction}


The percieved information must be corrected with the car's gyroscopic data,
because cameras get tilted Car position, tilt, velocity detection and correction,
odometric correction


\section{Depth correction}
Size based depth correction
Parallax motion based depth correction

\section{Lane, path and road detection}
Road segmentation, path  based on other actors
Drivable area reconstruction from other actors - more robust


\section{3D reconstruction}
Voxel reconstruction of actors
\section{Traffic light understanding}
\section{Foreign object detection}
White list based - difficult problem! (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13640-018-0261-2)

\section{Unsupervised learning methods}
One of the most exciting improvement after all improvements above have been
achieved is to research and implement Energy based models for self-driving cars,
I recommend reading the paper "A tutorial on energy-based
learning"~\cite{Lecun98gradient-basedlearning} by Yann LeCun et al.
